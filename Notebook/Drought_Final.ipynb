    "<h4> Overall Results</h4> \n",
    "<p> Throughout the year from August 2018 to August 2019 The drought levels have flucated from month to month, with various drought levels growing and shifting in this region. The peak of the drought season was seen from August 2018 to March 2019. </p>\n",
    "  <p>  From March until July we saw a decline in drought levels that may have been impacted by perciptation and snow melt, however without that data to collobrate we have no real way of knowing. In August of 2019 we saw an increase in Abnormal dryness starting to occur throughout all four states and this may suggest another drought season is about to occur. However, without continued data we don't know if this is accurate. </p>\n",
    "   <p> The drought trends throughout these four states presents us with a understanding of how drought has occured in this area for the past year. Given more time, I would have been able to add more data to get a better sense of if each of the 4 levels of drought affected crops and socioeconomic aspects. However, based on this research here we are able to understand that large areas of each of these four states saw some level of drought and therefore would have felt some impact. Whether that was from crop loss due to drought of water shortages based on severe drought. It is likely that there was some impact. </p> \n",
    "<h4> Limitations </h4>\n",
    "<p> One of the biggest Limitations was having enough time to get more data that would have provided a stronger understanding of just how much drought impacts people. Looking at the above maps, you can see that drought is occuring and that in some places it is severe, however without understanding the population of a certian region or understanding what farms were impacted, its hard to answer the question of So What?</p> \n",
    "<p> Drought can be hard to quantify because it is such a slow moving event that  often people do not realize it is occuring.\n",
    "    Adding additional data related to socioeconomic impacts, would help people connect how drought is directly impacting them and what changes they may need to make in their own lives in order to not feel the full extent of a server drought.</p> \n",
    "<h4> Conclusions </h4> \n",
    "<p> In conclusion, understanding drought levels and how it impacts the geography of a variety of states, should continue over larger periods of time to understand how climate change is impacting water avialability. </p> \n",
    "<p> Continue research should be conducted to understand how droughts change over time, how droughts affect crops and which ones are more prone to droughts vs which crops can withstand a drought for a period of time. There are lots of oppurtunities to continue to research and study droughts throughout this region. </p> \n"
